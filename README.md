# Fonts


## Personality of fonts
Certain fonts will encourage emotion and designed in a way that evokes emotion. Fonts/Type is the heart of most design, a simple font change can make a company/business go from restraunt to a kids play area depending on the type that is given. The fact that fonts hold so much power in the way they help us acknowledge what a company is about is incredible.
