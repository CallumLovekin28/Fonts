# Fonts


## Personality of fonts
Certain fonts will encourage emotion and designed in a way that evokes emotion. Fonts/Type is the heart of most design, a simple font change can make a company/business go from restraunt to a kids play area depending on the type that is given. The fact that fonts hold so much power in the way they help us acknowledge what a company is about is incredible.

## serif & sans-serif
Serif fonts are usually easier to read in printed works than sans-serif fonts.

This is because the serif make the individual letters more distinctive and easier for our brains to recognise quickly. Without the serif, the brain has to spend longer identifying the letter because the shape is less distinctive.

An important exception must be made for the web. Printed works generally have a resolution of at least 1,000 dots per inch; whereas, computer monitors are typically around 100 dots per inch.
This lower resolution can make small serif characters harder to read than the equivalent sans-serif characters because of their more complex shapes.
